# nlp-noun-clustering

Personal research project to see if it is possible to cluster nouns of similar type together based on the distributions of word classes in Wikipedia articles.
For example, the Wikipedia articles of Chicago and NYC are going to be more structurally similar than Chicago and dog. This GitHub repo is a collection of scripts and jupyter notebooks that get me closer to answering that question.
